The SNP is Scotland's Party. Only the SNP can be trusted
to put Scotland first at all times.

LET’S
MAKE
SCOTLAND
MATTER.

The more SNP MPs elected to Westminster, the more we
can do for our country.
A strong SNP means a strong Scotland.
Only a vote for the SNP will make Scotland
matter.
It is already clear that the UK parties are ignoring
Scotland in this election.

They are campaigning on policies that have no relevance

here. When Labour talks about the NHS, the Tories about
education or the Liberal Democrats about the Council Tax,
they are talking about policies that only apply south of
the border.
The SNP, on the other hand, can be – and are – trusted to
put Scotland first.
SNP MPs at Westminster – just like our MSPs at Holyrood

We outline our policies to make the Scottish economy
more competitive, restore dignity to our pensioners and
replace the unfair Council Tax. We also explain how we will

class public services. It gives more aid to developing
countries than any other nation. And it has invested its vast

oil revenues in a fund for the future that is now worth £85
billion.

If Norway can do it, why can’t Scotland?

Independence would give Scotland the freedom as a
nation that we value for ourselves as individuals.

The freedom to make our own decisions. To take
the action that will get our economy growing.

To choose for ourselves how we treat our pensioners.

The freedom to choose between ID cards and more police
on the streets.

To invest, not squander, our oil wealth. To get rid of nuclear
weapons and save our proud infantry regiments.
And to speak with our own voice in the world.

Independence is cherished and sought after the world over.
For Scotland, it would mean a better standard of life.
Independence would give us the freedom to build a
Scotland of which we can all be proud.

Scotland has enormous potential.

SCOTLAND
FLOURISH.

We have a well educated population and vast natural
resources.
Yet we have the lowest long-term economic
growth rate in the European Union.
That growth gap has cost Scotland billions of
pounds, and many of our best and brightest young
people.

We'll keep paying a heavy price until we decide to do
something about it.
It is predicted that Scotland will lose half a million people
over the next 40 years - the equivalent of losing a town the
size of Carnoustie, Alloa or Galashiels every single year.
It doesn’t have to be that way.

Instead, they have extended means

pensioners dependent on means testing now as there
were when Labour took office.

Many more miss out completely because they are too frail
or too proud to claim what they are entitled to.

As a result, one in every five pensioners in Scotland lives
in poverty.

The SNP believes that all pensioners deserve a decent
pension as of right.
We will end means testing once and for all.
We will pay all pensioners a Citizen’s Pension of at least
£110 for single pensioners and £168 for couples.
Entitlement to the Citizen’s Pension will be based on
residency in Scotland and not on contributions.

record levels.
Fewer patients are being treated now than when Labour
took office.
And hospital services all over Scotland are at risk of being
downgraded or closed altogether – which means that
many expectant mothers and people needing urgent
accident and emergency treatment will have to travel
further to get the care they need.
Labour and their Liberal Democrat partners in government
have failed to get to grips with the problems in our health
service.
The SNP will take action to tackle staff shortages in the
NHS. We will train 100 extra doctors every year. And we
will introduce measures to encourage doctors who come
from other countries to study here, to stay on and work in
the Scottish NHS when they graduate.
To get waiting times down faster, we will set up fast track
diagnostic and treatment centres – within the NHS, not
hived off to the private sector.

and it is still rising.
Average Band D Council Tax is now a massive £1,094.
That’s an increase this year of more than twice the rate
of inflation.
In England, Labour gave local authorities £1 billion to keep
Council Tax rises down.
The Labour and Liberal Democrat government in Scotland
got its share of that cash but refused to pass it on to hard
pressed Council Tax payers.
Instead, they stood back and watched Council Tax go up
again. By contrast, the SNP is committed to freezing
Council Tax this year.
But the Council Tax will always be unfair and unjust. It hits
working families and pensioners hardest.
Those on low incomes have to spend a far greater
proportion of their income on Council Tax than those who
are better off.
It also contributes to pensioner poverty.
That is why we will completely abolish it just as soon as we
can. The SNP will replace the Council Tax with a
progressive Local Income Tax based on the ability to pay.
Under our proposals, most people will pay less. And half of
pensioners will pay nothing at all.

Scottish waters. So it really is Scotland's oil.
Since 1997, Scotland has pumped over £35bn worth of oil
revenues into Treasury coffers.
Yet we have had precious little to show for it.
Successive UK chancellors have squandered Scotland’s oil
wealth. We musn't let it continue. The discovery of
significant new oil fields in the waters around Scotland
proves that there is still a lot more oil in Scottish waters.
With at least 28 billion barrels of oil left in Scottish waters,
we stand to benefit from a £600 billion windfall.
That is an asset equivalent to more than £100,000 for
every person in Scotland.
We have a chance to steward that money for the benefit of
future generations of Scots.
The SNP will set up a Scottish Oil Fund, to invest a share
of North Sea revenues for the future.
It’s not a new idea.
Norway set up an oil fund in the 1990s. Today, it is worth
£85 billion and will provide an income for the people of
Norway long after oil has run out.
It’s not too late for Scotland to follow suit.
A Scottish Oil Fund will make sure that our children and
grandchildren share in the benefits of Scotland’s win on
the natural lottery.

ID cards won’t catch criminals. More police will.

ID
CARDS
WON’T
CATCH
CRIMINALS...

Labour’s plans to introduce ID cards won’t deliver law
and order.

And they won’t make anyone safer in their own home
or community.

ID cards will cost Scottish taxpayers over £500 million over
the next ten years.

Everyone will have to pay at least £85 out of our own
pockets to get one.
And they won’t catch criminals.
Communities all over Scotland feel
the fear of crime.

But people don’t want useless bits of plastic.
They want and need more police on the streets.
The SNP will oppose the introduction of ID cards.
Instead, we will invest in effective security and crime
prevention measures and put more community police
officers on our streets.
Labour’s Big Brother tactics are about spreading fear and
national insecurity.
The SNP wants to build community security.
We want a Scotland where people can live safely and
securely, an Independent Scotland free from the fear
of crime.

our own voice in the world and take our place at the top

An SNP government will always uphold the rule of
international law. We believe that the war in Iraq was illegal
and we will always oppose wars waged without
international legal authority. We will ensure that Scotland
makes her contribution towards international peacekeeping and humanitarian missions.
We will join the world community where necessary to
preserve peace and security.
We will preserve our historic regiments and strategic
airforce bases as part of our Scottish Defence Services.
We will establish a Scottish Centre for Reconciliation and
Conflict Resolution, to promote peaceful alternatives to
armed conflict.
We support the Make Poverty History campaign to help the
poorest in our world.
We will contribute the UN target of 0.7% of national
income to international development.
And we will support the reform of international trade
organisations to create a more level playing field between
rich and poor nations.
We believe that Scotland is ready to take her place in
the world.

OUR RECORD
IN
WESTMINSTER.
The SNP is the hardest-working party in Westminster.
House of Commons figures show that SNP MPs have been
more active than MPs from any other party.
SNP MPs were elected on a pledge to stand up for Scotland in
Westminster. And that is exactly what they have done.
In the last session of Parliament, SNP MPs stood up for
Scotland’s regiments, our fishing and whisky industries,
our hospitals and universities. SNP MPs also stood firm against
the illegal war in Iraq and have been at the forefront of attempts
to impeach the Prime Minister for telling lies to the public.
In the next session of Parliament, it will be SNP MPs who will
continue the fight for our regiments, for dignity and decency for

our pensioners and against ID cards, the Council Tax,
and new Nuclear Power Stations in Scotland.
We know Labour can’t be trusted. The Tories have
always been anti-Scottish. And the Liberal Democrats
run down Labour in London only to prop them up in
Scotland. Only the SNP can be trusted always to stand
up for Scotland.
And the more SNP MPs there are, the more we can do
for Scotland.
